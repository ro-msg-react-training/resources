## Working Mode

The road-map consists of several steps. In each step, a set of theoretical concepts are explored, supported by reference documentation, book chapters, tutorials and videos. In parallel, a simple application will be built with the learned concepts: the *Online Shop* application.

After the learning material for a given step was sufficiently explored, either some new functionality will be added to this application or old functionality will be refactored.

All the code written must be published on GitHub. Access the [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/9-YuAfD4) to create your own repository. Commits must be pushed when each individual chapter is finished. In order to request a code review from the trainers, you must [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) from the `develop` to the `master` branch.

## Environment

You can work using your local environment:
 - You need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

In the `backend` folder you can find a server-side implementation for the online shop. To run this server perform the following:
 - Open the `backend` folder in your terminal
 - `npm ci` (only needed the first time your run the server)
 - `npm start`
 - Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.

## Online Shop
The application will simply browse through a catalog of products. It will support:

 - Listing the products,
 - Adding a new product,
 - Updating an existing product,
 - Deleting a product.
 
The online shop has a "shopping cart" functionality:
 - The user may add items into the cart,
 - He may increment and decrement the quantity of each product or even remove a product completely from the cart,
 - Lastly, he may checkout the cart and place an order (resulting in the creation of an order in the backend).

Mockups describing the user interface structure can be found in the [mockups](./mockups/mockups.pdf) folder.
These mockups should be used as a guideline, but improvements or deviations from them is allowed.

  - [Redux: Basic Tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial)

Online Shop:

  > Add a new "Edit" button on the detail page. Pressing it should open a new view, it shouldupdate the properties of the product. The view should have two buttons: "Cancel" (which undos all the changes) and "Save" (which calls the backend to persist the changes).
 >
 > Add some validation to your form (ex: check that the fields are not empty, that the price and weight inputs contain only numbers, etc.)
 >
 > Also create a new "Add" button on the product list. Pressing this button should open a view for creating a new product (which the same structure and buttons as the edit view).
 >
 > Store all application state in a Redux store.
 > 
 > Hints:
 >
 >  - Create a reducer for each page,
 >  - Add actions for each user input handler, data load event, etc. For each API call, you should create three actions: one which is dispatched when you do the fetch call, one which is dispatched if the fetch call succeeds and one if it fails. Example: `READ_PRODUCTS`, `READ_PRODUCTS_SUCCESS`, `READ_PRODUCTS_ERROR`.
 >  - Dispatch the actions and select the state **only** inside the container components.
 >  - Make sure to also have a loading flag indicator in each page's state,
 >  - Install the [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) Chrome plugin to be able to debug your store.
